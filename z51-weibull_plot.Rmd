The Weibull probability plot is not available directly in R. However, the plot
can be created using the formula ln[− ln(1 − p)] for the 5th, 15th, . . . , and 95th
percentiles as given in text. The sequence 0.05, 0.15, . . . , 0.95 is generated with
seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.1).

```{r}
with(xmp04.31, 
     plot(log(-log(1 - seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.1))), log(lifetime)))
```

```{r}
# Reasonable starting estimates are shape = 1, scale = 1000
# Do a simple evaluation at this set of parameters￿
sum(dweibull(xmp04.31$lifetime, shape=1, scale=1000, log=TRUE))


```

```{r}
# Optimization functions minimize so use negative log-likelihood
llfunc <- function(x) { # express as a function
 -sum(dweibull(xmp04.31$lifetime, shape=x[1], scale=x[2], log=TRUE))
}
```
